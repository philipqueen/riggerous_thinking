<h1>Classes</h1>
We teach rigging classes through <a href="https://www.paradisehighlines.com">Paradise</a>. There is a <b>Rigging Fundamentals</b> class, suitable for first time highliners through people who have been rigging for about a year. There is also an <b>ISA Prep</b> class, aimed at experienced highline riggers, that covers most of the material that's tested as part of the ISA Rigger's Certification. Each class is a 2.5 intensive, spanning Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon. The classes are located in either the Front Range of Colorado, near Boulder, or in near Moab, Utah. There is generally one of each class in the Spring and one of each class in the Fall.

To find out when and where the classes are for the year, and to purchase a spot, follow <a href="https://www.paradisehighlines.com/shop/p/highline-rigging-essentials-1">this link</a>.
