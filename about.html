<p>
    <strong>Riggerous Thinking</strong> is a website dedicated to highline rigging. Our focus is providing technical educational content for riggers of all skill levels. We hope to cover all aspects of the sport, from rigging fundamentals to advanced techniques, with a special focus on <em>new</em> and <em>previously undocumented</em> techniques. More than anything, we hope to promote <em>rigorous thinking</em> in the rigging space.

    <strong>Riggerous Thinking</strong> originally began as <a href="https://philipqueen.github.io/SlackBlog/">Philip's Slackline Blog</a>. Philip started the blog in July of 2022 to share the use of grog splices in split connections. The old blog was impossible to find, and didn't have a catchy name, so it was expanded to its present state in 2025.
